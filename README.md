Missing data in observational research is a curse
Ideally, missing data would be predicted as soon as patient is referred to the service
Patient comes with background factors: Age Sexe Hx Rx etc ...
Can these background factors be used to predict the occurence of missing values?
Good Predictions of the occurence of missing values based on background factors may 
1- inform clinicians on whether their next patient may be at risk of missing values, and therefore act accordingly (e.g. by re-calling patients)
2- better understand predictors of missing values 

# REHABase 
is a multicentric rehab database in France
When referred, patients are seen by:
1- the physician who gathers background data (Age, sex, hx, Rx etc ...); 
2- the nurse who collects rehab outcome data at baseline e.g. well-being, quality of life, adherence to treatment, self-esteem, insight, autonomy, self-stigmatisation, recovery
3- the neuropsychologist who collects neuropsych data e.g. IQ, attention or social cognition tests
