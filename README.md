Missing data in observational research is a curse
Ideally, missing data would be predicted as soon as patient is referred to the service
Patient comes with background factors: Age Sexe Hx Rx etc ...
Can these background factors be used to predict the occurence of missing values?
Good Predictions of the occurence of missing values based on background factors may 
1- inform clinicians on whether their next patient may be at risk of missing values, and therefore act accordingly (e.g. by re-calling patients)
2- Identifying predictors of missingness helps researchers understand potential biases in their data and develop strategies to minimize missing data in future studies
3- Improving data quality would lead to more accurate treatment effect estimates in research studies
4- Awareness of missing data patterns and their predictors allows for more nuanced interpretation of study findings, acknowledging potential biases or limitations.
5- Analyzing predictors of missingness can provide valuable information about the profiles of service users and their engagement with rehabilitation programs.

# REHABase 
is a multicentric rehab database in France
When referred, patients are seen by:
1- the physician who gathers background data (Age, sex, hx, Rx etc ...); 
2- the nurse who collects rehab outcome data at baseline e.g. well-being, quality of life, adherence to treatment, self-esteem, insight, autonomy, self-stigmatisation, recovery
3- the neuropsychologist who collects neuropsych data e.g. IQ, attention or social cognition tests

# RQ
1- Can missing rehab outcome data at baseline be predicted based on background factors?
2- What are the influence of these factors in missingness?
3- Do the predictive model and variable importance vary per diagnosis group and questionnaire/test missing
